URLs that contain user information, you must filter the user information out of
the data that you send to Google. Instructions for filtering such information
can be found in the Sitemap Generator configuration instructions.

In addition, you must add language to your privacy policy substantially similar
to the following: "This site uses a tool that collects your requests for pages
